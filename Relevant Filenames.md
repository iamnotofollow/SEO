# File Naming Style - 
- The file name should preferably be short and descriptive
- It is always good to use same keywords in the filename as well as in the page title
- Use actual service name in your filename such as myservice.htm, because filename's such as service.htm or job.htm are generic
- Do not use more than 3-4 words in the filename
- Separate the keywords with hyphen(-) rather than underscores(_)
- Try to use two keywords if possible

Hyphens create space between the keywords in the file name. `try-this.htm` as `try this` (good)
Where as underscore removes the spaces in file name making the name as single word. `try_this.htm` as `trythis` (bad)

# File Extensions - 
File extensions like .html, .php, .htm or any other extension will do nothing for a user. 
The file name extensions may not help the user, as the user is concerned about `WHAT` is produced than `HOW` it is produced.
Even URL sub directory also makes no matter to the user.

Restrict the file size to less than 101K because Google chops almost every thing above it.
