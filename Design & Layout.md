The website design and the layout gives the first impression about your site.

## Steps
- You should have more text content than the HTML elements. The actual page content should have a keyword density of about 10% 
and should weigh in at about 200 words.
- No frames. Frames are the enemies of the search engines and vice-versa.
- No ads if possible. Because most of the ads use javascript which is not advised to be used.
- No javascript. If javascript is needed, then it should be loaded from external file rather than dumping it in to the HTML.
JS dropdown menus prevents spiders from crawling beyond the homepage. If js dropdowns are used, then text links at the bottom of the page.
- No unnecessary directories. Keeping the files as close to the root as possible.
- No fancy stuff unless absolutely necessary. If the site is designed complicatedly, the search engine would not be able to parse 
the content of the site properly and finally indexing would not be efficient which results in a low rank.
