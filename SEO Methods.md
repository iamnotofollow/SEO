# SEO Methods
SEO techniques are classified into two brand categories.

## White Hat SEO - 
Technique that search engines recommend as part of a good design.
- It conforms to the search engine guidelines
- It does not involve in any deception
- It ensures that the content a search engine indexes, and subsequently ranks, is the same content the user will see
- It ensures that the web page content should have been created for the user and not for the sake of search engines
- It ensures good quality of web pages
- It ensures availabilty of useful content on the web pages

## Black Hat or Spamdexing - 
Technique that the search engines do not approve and attempt to minimize the effect of.
- Attempting ranking improvements that are disapproved by the search engines
- Redirecting users from a page that is built for search engines to one that is more human friendly
- Redirecting users to a page that is different from the page that the search engine ranked
- ##### `Cloaking tactics` is serving one version of a page to search engine spider/bots and showing another version to human visitors
- Using hidden or invisible text or with page background color, using tiny font size or hiding them within the HTML code
- #### `Metatag Stuffing` is repeating keywords in metatags and using that keywords that are unrelated to the website content
- #### `Keyword Stuffing` is calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety and density of the page
- #### `Doorway or Gateway pages` are low quality web pages created with very little content but are instead stuffed with similar keywords and phrases
- #### `Mirror websites` is hosting multiple websites - all conceptually with similar content but with different urls
- #### `Page Hijacking` is creating a rough copy of a popular website which show content similar to the original to a web crawler, but redirects web surfers to unrelated or malicious websites

To improve page ranking avoid all the `Black Hat` tactics, as the search engines are smart enough to identify all the above properties of a website.
